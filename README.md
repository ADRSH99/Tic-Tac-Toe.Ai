Winter 2024 C++ Project by Adarsh Bellamane.

There are 3 types of Tic Tac Toe Games in this repo.
First, that can be played between two people.

Second, that can be played against a dumb computer.
The logic behind this is random number generation that generates a row and column by
few mathematical operations and played out by the computer.

Third, that can be played against a smart computer.
The smart computer Tic Tac Toe Game is basically playing against AI, we need it to make smart
choices instead of random choices. To enable the computer to do this, we use an advanced algorithm.
The third TTT game makes use of the Minimax algorithm, this algorithm is utilized by the means of 
backtracking and recursive techniques. 

The Minimax algorithm is a strategy used in decision-making and game theory to minimize the
possible loss for a worst-case scenario. It assumes that both players in a game play optimally,
with one trying to maximize their score and the other trying to minimize it. The algorithm works 
by exploring all possible moves, calculating the potential outcomes, and 
selecting the move that leads to the best possible result based on this evaluation
